The RColony package provides simple tools for the implementation of the Colony pedigree analysis software.

## Installation

This fork of the package can be installed from github using

```r
remotes::install_github("aj2duncan/rcolony")
```

At the moment I am working of testing the package with the most recent version of Colony (2.0.6.5) and then I hope to submit a pull request to amalgamate everything. 

The original version of the package can be found here [https://github.com/jonesor/rcolony](https://github.com/jonesor/rcolony) and is available on Rforge [r-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=399) and can be installed using

```r
install.packages("rcolony", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
```
